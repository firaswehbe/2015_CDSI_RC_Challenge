# REDCap Challenge Holiday 2015 Edition

This repo is for a toy project and challenge ahead of the CDSI Developers'
meeting on January 13, 2016 in which I will demo the REDCap API Demo.

To get the most of the demo, you can participate ahead of time in this 
collaborative project. This would:

1. Give you a chance to work through REDCap's interface for data capture projects
including building forms and online surveys.
2. Familiarize you with the data model of the specific project that I will demo
using the API.
3. Demonstrate how you can manipulate data in and out of a REDCap project using the
point-and-click interface, the import/export modules, or -- if you feel like
programming -- using an API token which I will enable for you in your individual
toy project.
4. Gather data and learn something about your fellow challenge participants.

To participate and find out what the next step is, fill the following survey.
