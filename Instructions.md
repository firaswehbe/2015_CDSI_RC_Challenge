# Instructions

You have access to two projects in REDCap now:

1. `REDCap API CDSI Dev Talk`: This is the project for which you just filled your
participation survey. Your response (including your secretphrase) and the
responses from everyone else are are stored in this project. This will be
referred to as the `Master Project`.
2. `CDSI Challenge for $YOURNETID`: A blank project that you will use to survey
all the other challenge participants. Feel free to rename this project. This
will be referred to as `Your Personal Project`.

Your task which is due on **Tuesday January 12, 2016 at midnight** is to build a
survey in Your Personal Project and send that survey to everyone whose name is
in the Master Project. 

Like you, everyone whose name ends up in the Master Project has provided a
passphrase while filling the participation survey. You will need to use REDCap
to send each person a personalized survey link which displays to them the
secretphrase that they have provided... to assure them that the survey is sent
by a fellow participant. 

To support that, your Your Personal Project will need to include at least the
following 4 variables all of which also exist in the Master Project:

* `first_name`
* `last_name`
* `email`
* `secretphrase`

You will need to in your survey
everyone who have responded to the survey in `REDCap API CDSI Dev Talk`
